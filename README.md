CAPSTONE PROJECT 
Team: Nisha Ramasubramonian, Justin Bowser, Ben Wixon, Hassan Radawan, Daylyn Mosher
Project Set-up: Through data science, a major retail chain finds that some of its product offerings and brand manufacturers account for smaller and smaller percentages of its revenue. The retailer would like to identify which products and manufacturers should be eliminated from its offerings so it can optimize its inventory and see increased demand forecasts.
Dataset: The dataset is for a retailer with many stores and is rich with insights from thousands of individual transactions, as well as store, product, and advertising details. Also included in the data is buying history and demographics for 2500 individual households, which paints a vivid picture of who is buying what products, where they are buying them, and how they are being incentivized.
